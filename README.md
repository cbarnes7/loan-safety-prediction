The LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending company that directly connects borrowers and potential lenders/investors. 
In this notebook, you will build a classification model to predict whether or not a loan provided by LendingClub is likely to default. 
In this assignment, you will practice:

-Use Pandas Dataframes to do feature engineering
-Train a decision tree model to predict the sentiment of product reviews.
-Visualize the decision tree
-Predict the probability of a certain label using the tree
-Investigate how the complexity of the tree affects the results
